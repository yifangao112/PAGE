# The Professional Go Annotation Dataset

![Teaser image](./assets/PAGE.png)

The **P**rofession**a**l **G**o Annotation Datas**e**t (PAGE) is a high-quality Go dataset with extensive annotations, containing 98,525 games played by 2,007 professional players from 1950 to 2021. We annotated both game-level metadata and in-game statistics across two dimensions. The game-level metadata includes information about the game, player, and tournament. The in-game statistics generated by KataGo include win rate, score differences, uncertainty, ownership, and recommended actions for each move.
